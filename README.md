## Getting Started

```javascript
// Create our Collector
const Collector = require('reviews-collector-ios');
// Create an instance of Collector to get reviews of Google Maps and MapQuest and only parse 2 pages max
const collector = new Collector(['585027354', '316126557'], { maxPages: 2 });

// Do something when we parse a review
collector.on('review', (result) => {
	console.log(`Found a ${result.review.rating} star review`);
});

// Do something when we finish parsing a page of reviews
collector.on('page complete', (result) => {
	console.log(`Finished page ${result.pageNum} of ${result.appId} and found ${result.reviews.length} reviews`);
});

// Do something when we are done parsing an app
collector.on('done collecting', (result) => {
	if (result.error) {
		console.error('Stopped collecting because something went wrong');
	} else {
		console.log(`Finished collecting reviews for ${result.appId}`);
	}
});

// Exit once we are done with all of the apps
collector.on('done with apps', () => {
	console.log('Finished collecting reviews for all of the apps');
	process.exit();
});

// Start collecting reviews
collector.collect();
```

## Instantiating
First, create a `Collector` prototype by requiring `reviews-collector-ios`

```javascript
var Collector = require('reviews-collector-ios');
```

Next, create an `Collector` instance using the `new` keyword and passing an app ID (or an array of app IDs) and an options object

```javascript
// The app Id argument can be a single app ID string...
var singleAppCollector = new Collector('585027354', { maxPages: 2 });
// ...or an array of app ID strings
var multiAppCollector = new Collector(['585027354', '316126557'], { maxPages: 2 });
```

Where the arguments are:

- `App ID` *(string|string[])*: The app ID is the portion after the `/id` in the iTunes URL (e.g. the app ID for this URL - `https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-maps-real-time-navigation/id585027354?mt=8` - would be `585027354`). You can pass a single app ID as a string, or multiple app IDs as an array of strings
- `Options` *(Object)*: An object with any (or none) of the following properties:
  - `maxPages` *(Default 5)*: The maximum number of pages of reviews to parse. Use 0 for unlimited
  - `userAgent` *(Default iTunes/12.1.2 (Macintosh; OS X 10.10.3) AppleWebKit/0600.5.17)*: The user agent string to use when making requests
  - `delay` *(Default 1000)*: The delay (in milliseconds) between page requests
  - `maxRetries` *(Default 3)*: The maximum number of times to retry a page that could not be parsed before giving up


## Listening for Events
Several events are triggered as the Collector parses reviews. You can setup event listeners for these using:

```javascript
collector.on('<EVENT NAME>', function (result) {
	// Do something with the result every time the event is fired
});
```

Where the event name is one of:

- `'review'`
  - Fires when: A review is parsed from the page
  - Emits:

    ```javascript
	{
		appId: '<APP_ID>',
		pageNum: '<PAGE_NUMBER>',
		review: { /* Review object */ }
	}
    ```
- `'page complete'`
  - Fires when: A page of reviews has been parsed
  - Emits:

    ```javascript
	{
		appId: '<APP_ID>',
		pageNum: '<PAGE_NUMBER>',
		reviews: [ /* Review objects */ ]
	}
    ```
- `'done collecting'`
  - Fires when: The collector has finished collecting reviews for a particular app for one of the following reasons:
     - The collector's `maxPages` limit is reached for an app
     - The collector reaches the last page of reviews for the app
     - The collector's `maxRetries` limit is reached for an app
  - Emits:

    ```javascript
	{
		appId: '<APP_ID>',
		pageNum: '<PAGE_NUMBER>',
		appsRemaining: 0, // # of apps left in queue
		error: undefined || { /* Error object */ }
	}
    ```
- `'done with apps'`
  - Fires when: Processing has completed for all of the apps
  - Emits: Nothing


## Starting the Collector
Once you have created an instance of Collector and setup your event listeners, you can begin the collection process using:

```javascript
collector.collect();
```

The Collector will then collect reviews until it reaches one of the stop points described in the `done collecting` event (see above)


## To Do:

- Use request instead of node-webcrawler
- Allow for multiple app IDs in a single Collector (create a map of appIDs + emit the appId)
- Allow user to determine whether or not to keep going after each page (if desired)
- Move these to GitHub Issues
